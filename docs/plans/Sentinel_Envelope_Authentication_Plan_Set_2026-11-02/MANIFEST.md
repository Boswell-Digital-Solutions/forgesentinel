# Sentinel Envelope Authentication Plan Set Manifest

- Plan ID: **BDS-SNT-ENVELOPE-AUTH-001**
- Finding: **KI-SENTINEL-20261102-008**
- Generated: **2026-11-02**
- Revision: **rulings R1-A to R1-E recorded; amendment 3 supersedes D-2's bound record count of 41 and states no replacement; slice SL added; three further R1-C rulings recorded — the measurement is a conditional baseline (14 to 18 of 51, by family scoping and `control_origin`) and S2's scope is all 51 declared fields, and `integrity.signature` gets syntax validation; owner rulings on the four recommendations applied; PR #39 review rulings 5 and 6 applied; gate 5 extended to every pre-authentication failure; two round-1 decisions open (R1-F, R1-G; R1-H ruled); implementation stays unauthorized**
- Remediated: **blocking items 7 and 8 are corrected (2026-11-03): no Ed25519 representation is presented as approved, the HMAC text-form citation names the code that enforces it rather than a sentence about `credential.token`, and the flat admit figure is stated conditionally. Blocking item 6 was **withdrawn as a finding**: the S2-before-S6 sequencing ruling is the owner's, issued 2026-11-02 and re-confirmed 2026-11-03, and the text that called it invented is removed. `KI-SENTINEL-20261102-020` records that episode and its control.**

Amendment 3 in `06` supersedes the bound record count, so four things in this plan set are knowingly stale and slice S1 regenerates them: the 41-row field table in `01`, the 41-record and 1479-byte worked example in `01`, every record **index** cited in `01`, `02`, `04`, `05`, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and `docs/sentinel/adrs/ADR-027-envelope-authentication-format.md`, and the golden vector. Each site is marked where it sits.

Round 2 must run against a frozen commit, named in `07_REVIEW_ROUND_1_FINDINGS.md` before the review starts (review finding F0).

Round 2 assesses the gate-5 record shape against slice SL, not against this track, because ruling R1-D moved `src/spine/ledger.ts` out of it.
