The hashes above cover the documents as they stand. They are not a statement that the content is current.

Amendment 3 in `06` supersedes the bound record count, so four things in this plan set are knowingly stale and slice S1 regenerates them: the 41-row field table in `01`, the 41-record and 1479-byte worked example in `01`, every record **index** cited in `01`, `02`, `04`, `05`, `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and `docs/sentinel/adrs/ADR-027-envelope-authentication-format.md`, and the golden vector. Each site is marked where it sits.

Round 2 must run against a frozen commit, named in `07_REVIEW_ROUND_1_FINDINGS.md` before the review starts (review finding F0).

Round 2 assesses the gate-5 record shape against slice SL, not against this track, because ruling R1-D moved `src/spine/ledger.ts` out of it.
